step 1: first you need to open command prompt and to desk top then you need to connect it with aws, 
for that you first needto make a iam user and give it full access then copy this command and add credential user in it:
serverless config credentials --provider provider --key key --secret secret
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key kldjlkflkfjflkjlk --secret lkdljflkflklkd

step 2:go to serverless documentation and go to tutorial, all steps follow from it,
npm install -g serverless
serverless 
click on next next next and follow the http api wali command pa ok kerna hai
now set region first check your region in lamda then in set in serverless.yml file:
region: us-east-1
then in command prompt write command for deployment
sls deploy 
then it will start deploy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
now steps to connent and use dynamodb with serverless;
step 1:we will follow the same tutorial and then copy code from tutorial and then add values init;
resources:
  Resources:
    CustomerTable:
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      Properties:
        AttributeDefinitions:
          - AttributeName: id
            AttributeType: S
        BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: id
            KeyType: HASH
        TableName: firsttable or anyname you want

then use command sls deploy;

step 2: now install npm package manger by using command;
npm init
we install package manage npm to install different packages;
now for id and for aws we will install two packages uuid and aws-sdk package from npm;

step 3: npm i uuid and npm i aws-sdk

using document continue on fuction and give permission to it;
you will copy some permission on serverless.yml file then go to dynamoDb database, go to table and 
now you need the unique identifier to wheich you are going to giving permission for example in current 
case it is
arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:994135220557:table/firsttable
you will find the above identifer inside table , go to overview and then additional setting;
-------------------------
important: for debugging go to cloudwatch there you can see errors and then inside check log and then  check inside log groups
-------------------------

sls deploy ---deploy everything
sls deploy -f functionname    ---deploy function only
